Q1. Question: "What is the age of Aman?"
Statements:
I. Aman is 4 years younger than his brother, whose age is twice the age of their sister.
II. The sum of the ages of Aman, his brother, and their sister is 36 years.
a) Statement I alone is sufficient, but II alone is not sufficient
b) Statement II alone is sufficient, but I alone is not sufficient
c) Both statements I and II together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient
d) Each statement alone is sufficient
e) Statements I and II together are not sufficient

Answer: c)
Explanation: Statement I alone gives a relation but not exact ages. Statement II alone gives total age but not individual ages. 
             Together, both statements are sufficient to find Aman’s age.


Q2. Question: "What is the speed of a train in km/h?"
Statements:
I. The train covers 180 km in 2 hours less than it takes to cover 270 km at 30 km/h.
II. The train covers 450 km in 5 hours.
a) Statement I alone is sufficient, but II alone is not sufficient
b) Statement II alone is sufficient, but I alone is not sufficient
c) Both statements I and II together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient
d) Each statement alone is sufficient
e) Statements I and II together are not sufficient

Answer: d)
Explanation: Statement I allows calculation of speed = distance/time difference. Statement II directly gives speed = 450/5 = 90 km/h. 
             Each statement alone is sufficient.


Q3. Question: "Is x² – 5x + 6 = 0 true for some integer x?"
Statements:
I. x² – 5x + 6 = (x – 2)(x – 3)
II. x is a positive integer less than 5.
a) Statement I alone is sufficient, but II alone is not sufficient
b) Statement II alone is sufficient, but I alone is not sufficient
c) Both statements I and II together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient
d) Each statement alone is sufficient
e) Statements I and II together are not sufficient

Answer: c)
Explanation: Statement I factors the equation but does not indicate integer solutions alone.
             Statement II gives a range for x. Together, x = 2 or 3, which satisfies the equation.


Q4. Question: "What is the value of p/q?"
Statements:
I. 2p + 3q = 12
II. p – q = 2
a) Statement I alone is sufficient, but II alone is not sufficient
b) Statement II alone is sufficient, but I alone is not sufficient
c) Both statements I and II together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient
d) Each statement alone is sufficient
e) Statements I and II together are not sufficient

Answer: c)
Explanation: Statement I alone has two variables; insufficient. Statement II alone has two variables; insufficient. 
             Together, we can solve 2p + 3q = 12 and p – q = 2 → p/q = 4/2 = 2.


Q5. Question: "How many students in a class passed both mathematics and science?"
Statements:
I. Out of 60 students, 40 passed mathematics and 35 passed science.
II. 15 students failed in both mathematics and science.
a) Statement I alone is sufficient, but II alone is not sufficient
b) Statement II alone is sufficient, but I alone is not sufficient
c) Both statements I and II together are sufficient, but neither alone is sufficient
d) Each statement alone is sufficient
e) Statements I and II together are not sufficient

Answer: c)
Explanation: Statement I alone does not tell us how many passed both subjects. Statement II alone does not give passing numbers.
             Together, total students – failed both = 60 – 15 = 45 students passed at least one; using inclusion-exclusion, passed both = 40 + 35 – 45 = 30.
